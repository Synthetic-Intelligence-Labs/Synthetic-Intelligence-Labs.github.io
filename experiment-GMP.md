    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Synthetic Intelligence Labs is dedicated to advancing neuroscience through data analysis and experiment design for human cortical spheroids. This document codifies the GMP standards upheld to ensure the quality, safety, and integrity of all research endeavors.</p>

    <h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
    <p>The operational framework at Synthetic Intelligence Labs encompasses comprehensive oversight of all aspects related to GMP compliance. This includes the integration of research and development, operations, and quality management into a streamlined process.</p>

    <h2>3. Personnel</h2>
    <p>Training in GMP principles, remote experimentation protocols, data integrity, and ethical considerations is integral to maintaining the highest standards of research. Adherence to health and hygiene practices is rigorously observed to prevent any potential contamination or compromise of experimental integrity.</p>

    <h2>4. Facilities and Equipment</h2>
    <p>The remote experimentation platform and data analysis tools are maintained on secured computers, with regular updates to ensure the utmost security and operational reliability.</p>

    <h2>6. Quality Control</h2>
    <p>Integrated quality control measures span the entire research process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In-process monitoring of experimental parameters.</li>
        <li>Comprehensive data analysis with rigorous integrity and validity checks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Documentation</h2>
    <p>A robust documentation system is in place, detailing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for experimental and operational processes.</li>
        <li>Records of experiment designs, execution logs, and analysis outcomes.</li>
        <li>Equipment maintenance schedules and calibration records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Complaints and Recalls</h2>
    <p>Procedures for addressing any issues with the research process or outcomes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Systematic logging and investigation of any identified anomalies.</li>
        <li>Measures for rectifying or repeating experiments to uphold quality standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Audit and Review</h2>
    <p>Regular audits ensure ongoing compliance with GMP standards, with immediate action taken to address any identified areas for improvement, reinforcing the commitment to research excellence and integrity.</p>
